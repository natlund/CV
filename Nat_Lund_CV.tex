\section{Work History}

\cventry{Aug 2018 -- Present}{Data Engineer}{\textsc{Flexciton}}{London UK}{www.flexciton.com}
{Flexciton helps industrial factories solve the problem of production scheduling, by providing a web interface to a state-of-the-art scheduling optimisation algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Worked on the repository code layer that translates between a Postgres database and Python domain model objects using the sqlalchemy library.
	\item General back-end development in the Flask web app.
	\item Wrote an Ontology, working with all stakeholders to converge on definitions of all key concepts, and creating schematic diagrams of the conceptual relationships.
	\item Wrote documentation, including docs that reduced the on-boarding time for a new developer from three days down to one day.
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{Sep 2016 -- May 2018}{Software Engineer, Data Scientist}{\textsc{Metail}}{Cambridge UK}{www.metail.co.uk}
{Metail is a fashion-tech startup that builds virtual fitting-room 3-D modelling technology for use on fashion retail websites, and provides a digital composite photography service.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Data Science} Various ad-hoc business analyses, typically using Python and SQL to query an Amazon Redshift database, and Python pandas for data processing.
		\item Maintained and extended Looker, a graphical business intelligence tool. Trained users.
		\item \textbf{Physics Modelling} Learnt C++, and analysed and documented an 8,000-line physics modelling code that had been untouched for 5 years. Did minor refactoring and extension.
		\item Wrote 40 pages of technical documentation and 80 slides of diagrams detailing the physics modelling code. Explained how it works to non-technical users.
		\item \textbf{Machine Learning} Converted an image segmentation Convolutional Neural Network from the R\&D team into Python code.  Helped deploy it as a microservice on Amazon.
	\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jun 2014 -- Mar 2015}{Data Scientist}{\textsc{Publons}}{Wellington NZ}{www.publons.com}
{Worked in a rapidly-growing internet startup using the Python web framework Django.  Main projects included data cleanup, name disambiguation, text matching, search, and statistics.  Additional work included basic web programming, and user interface design.  
%I also did planning and strategizing, and relating with various stakeholders.
\begin{itemize}
%	\item Investigated raw data, and wrote heuristic code to sanitise it automatically.
	\item Wrote heuristic code to flag suspicious data, thus enabling data cleanup.
	\item Researched string matching algorithms, and implemented a modified version that gave best results for matching names.
	\item Built a prototype search engine from basic Python language processing and linear algebra components.
	%(It was later replaced by the industry-standard Lucene engine, which is mathematically equivalent.)
	%\item Generated summary statistics of key company data, with careful attention to graphical presentations that gave the easiest comprehension.
	%\item Developed a rating system designed to allow meaningful comparison of published articles.

\cventry{2014}{PhD in Theoretical Physics}{Victoria University of Wellington}{New Zealand}{}{Fluid Mechanics (Microfluidics)}

\cventry{2004}{BSc in Mathematics and Physics}{Victoria University of Wellington}{New Zealand}{}{}%{\textsc{A-- average}}

\subsection{Doctoral Thesis}

\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Effective Slip Lengths for Stokes Flow over Rough, Mixed-Slip Surfaces}}
\cvitem{Supervisor}{Professor Shaun Hendy}
\cvitem{Description}{The motivation was the recent development of surfaces patterned on the nano scale that offer reduced drag to liquids flowing over them.  The physics was modelled as incompressible Stokes flow with a rough, periodic boundary condition.  Analytic solutions were obtained by the perturbation and homogenization methods, yielding a prediction of the improved flow of liquids over nano-patterned surfaces.
}

% \cvitem{Examiner's Remark}{``This [introductory] chapter describes fairly standard fluid mechanics concepts but with a \textbf{depth and clarity which is very rarely found even in classical fluid mechanics textbooks}. It is an absolute pleasure to read even if this chapter contains very little new/original results. The candidate does a very good job of explaining complex concepts with clear and concise arguments."}
