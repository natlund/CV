\section{Education}

\cventry{2014}{PhD in Theoretical Physics}{Victoria University of Wellington}{New Zealand}{}{Fluid Mechanics (Microfluidics)}
\cventry{2006}{BSc Honours in Physics}{Victoria University of Wellington}{New Zealand}{}{First Class Honours}
\cventry{2004}{BSc in Mathematics and Physics}{Victoria University of Wellington}{New Zealand}{}{}%{\textsc{A-- average}}

\section{Doctoral Thesis}

\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Effective Slip Lengths for Stokes Flow over Rough, Mixed-Slip Surfaces}}
\cvitem{Supervisor}{Professor Shaun Hendy}
\cvitem{Description}{The motivation was the recent development of surfaces patterned on the nano scale that offer reduced drag to liquids flowing over them.  The physics was modelled as incompressible Stokes flow with a rough, periodic boundary condition.  Analytic solutions were obtained by the perturbation and homogenization methods, yielding a prediction of the improved flow of liquids over nano-patterned surfaces.
}

% \cvitem{Examiner's Remark}{``This [introductory] chapter describes fairly standard fluid mechanics concepts but with a \textbf{depth and clarity which is very rarely found even in classical fluid mechanics textbooks}. It is an absolute pleasure to read even if this chapter contains very little new/original results. The candidate does a very good job of explaining complex concepts with clear and concise arguments."}

\cvitem{Examiner's Remark}{``[This] chapter describes ... fluid mechanics concepts with a \textbf{depth and clarity which is very rarely found even in classical fluid mechanics textbooks}. It is an absolute pleasure to read... The candidate does a very good job of explaining complex concepts with clear and concise arguments."}

%\cvitem{Off-Topic Project}{To gain some insight into the global financial crisis, I studied \textbf{fractional-reserve banking} and reviewed Nassim Taleb's \textbf{`Black Swan'}.}

%\cvitem{Other Work}{I volunteered my services on a complex systems project.  I learnt Python, taught it to other students, and wrote scripts to \textbf{extract data} from a million-line text file and create \textbf{network graphs} from the data.}

\cvitem{Intermediate}{Python, \LaTeX\ } %(for mathematical typesetting, eg: $\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = 0$)}
\cvitem{Basic}{SQL; Python scientific libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy; Linux; Amazon cloud services; Git, Agile development; Django web framework}


\section{Communication Skills}

\subsection{Vocational}

\cventry{Sep 2016 -- Mar 2018}{Software Engineer, Data Scientist}{\textsc{Metail}}{Cambridge UK}{www.metail.co.uk}
{Metail is a fashion-tech startup that builds virtual fitting-room 3-D modelling technology for use on fashion retail websites, possibly pivoting to a digital composite photography service.  I worked in three areas: Data Science, physics modelling in C++, and deploying a machine-learning microservice with AWS.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The data science technology stack centred on the use of Python and SQL to query an Amazon Redshift database, and Python pandas for data processing.
	\item Did various ad-hoc business analyses of user behaviour, as well as more exploratory modelling eg. created a flowchart of user behaviour and transition probabilities.
	\item Maintained and extended Looker, a graphical business intelligence dashboard tool.  Conducted training on Looker for non-technical users.
	\item Learnt C++ and read through an 8,000-line physics modelling code base that had been untouched for 5 years.  Did minor refactoring and extension.
	\item The physics code modelled fabric as a spring-mass network, with collisions and gravity.
	\item Wrote comprehensive documentation of the physics code, including 40 pages of technical prose and 80 slides of diagrams.
	\item Explained the workings -- and quirks -- of the physics code to non-technical consumers of the physics modelling software, thereby resolving long-standing puzzles.
	\item Converted an image segmentation Convolutional Neural Network model from the R\&D team into Python code suitable for wider consumption.
	\item Helped deploy the image segmentation machine-learning model as a Python microservice on Amazon.
\end{itemize}

%Details:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Text-processing to automatically shorten hotel names to fit into advertisement formats.
	%\item Wrote code to extract data and plot graphs of various business metrics.
	\item Developed scoring system to rate relevance of advertising copy to search query terms.  Wrote code to score advertisements, generate a table of actionable items, and email the table to automatically assigned Account Managers.
	%\item Wrote Python code to connect to a Hive/Hadoop cluster, run SQL queries, etc.

\cventry{Jun 2014 -- Mar 2015}{Data Scientist}{\textsc{Publons}}{Wellington NZ}{www.publons.com}
{Worked in a rapidly-growing internet startup using the Python web framework Django.  Main projects included data cleanup, name disambiguation, text matching, search, and statistics.  Additional work included basic web programming, and user interface design.  
%I also did planning and strategizing, and relating with various stakeholders.
%\newline{}
%Details:
\begin{itemize}
%	\item Investigated raw data, and wrote heuristic code to sanitise it automatically.
	\item Wrote heuristic code to flag suspicious data, thus enabling data cleanup.
	\item Researched string matching algorithms, and implemented a modified version that gave best results for matching names.
	\item Built a prototype search engine from basic Python language processing and linear algebra components.
	%(It was later replaced by the industry-standard Lucene engine, which is mathematically equivalent.)
	%\item Generated summary statistics of key company data, with careful attention to graphical presentations that gave the easiest comprehension.
	%\item Developed a rating system designed to allow meaningful comparison of published articles.
